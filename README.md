# Stock-Market-Forecasting
Many problems in computer vision were saturating on their accuracy before a 
decade. However, with the rise of Machine Learning techniques, the accuracy of 
these problems drastically improved. One of the major problem was that of data 
prediction or forecasting. A slightly complicated problem of outcome forecasting 
on the given data set.
Data mining techniques allows us to find patterns and trends in data in an efficient 
manner using a quantitative approach. This particular aspect makes these 
techniques an ideal choice for application to stock markets where trends and 
patterns can be used for prediction. Techniques like Neural Networks (LSTM) and 
FBProphet, are used in this project for forecasting stock prices.
